# Hotel Recommendation System using Machine Learning

## Overview
The **Hotel Recommendation System** is a machine learning-based application that suggests hotels to users based on various factors such as user preferences, ratings, reviews, and location. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze past user behavior and hotel features to provide personalized recommendations.

## Features
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggests hotels based on user preferences and past choices.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Uses past interactions of users to recommend similar hotels.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends hotels based on their features and user interests.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes customer reviews to determine hotel sentiment.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and interactive UI for searching and booking hotels.
- **Map Integration**: Shows recommended hotels on a map for better visualization.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Natural Language Processing**: NLTK, TextBlob (for sentiment analysis)
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Web Framework (Optional)**: Flask or Django (for UI integration)
- **Database**: MySQL / SQLite (for storing user data and preferences)

## Dataset
The system can use datasets such as:
- **TripAdvisor/Expedia Booking Data**
- **Hotel Reviews and Ratings Dataset**
- **User Interaction Data (clicks, searches, past bookings)**
